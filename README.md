## 🗣️About
###### [📖t.o.c.](#📖toc)

Astral is a 2D game developed in C++ using the SDL2 library. The game is made for a University
final project, formerly T.C.C., for UFMG (Federal University of Minas Gerais).

This game is born from the desire to create a game on my own, as a project, to better understand
topics and content that I had learned during my Informations Systems course.

Here, I'll cover topics as Pathfinding algorithms, State machines and mathematics, in order to
create an INDIE game.

Along my course, I had a discipline called "Digital games development", where I learned the core
concepts needed for game development, and I had the opportunity, together with my colleagues, to
create a simple game, that looks like a proper Game engine, using C++ and SDL2. That game specifically
was called "Eter", and it's code is a start point to this project, called "Astral".

Both games will differ completely, but many of code can be reused as a starting point for later modifications.

I'd like to credit my colleagues __Eduarda Mendes, Mariana Assis, Luiza Viana__, and mainly, __***Lucas Ferreira***__, that was my
teacher during the discipline, and now my Mentor for this project.
